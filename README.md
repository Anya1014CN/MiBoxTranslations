2. Login to GitHub and [fork](https://github.com/Anya1014CN/MiBoxTranslations/fork) the repository
3. Then create a new file with a name in the format "language.ini", e.g. "English.ini", "简体中文.ini", etc. Please do not include spaces in the name, if you need spaces, please use "_" to connect, e.g. "Bahasa_Indonesia.ini"
4. Copy all the contents of English.ini to the file you just created.
5. You are ready to start your translation work.  (Note: You only need to translate the content to the right of the "=", please do not translate the content to the left of the "=" and the content in the "[ ]" brackets, because doing so will cause your translation to will not be read by MiBox!)
